Bootstrap 5 Carousel

A bootstrap carousel the advances one element at a time in either direction. It's responsive and stacks to a single column below 768px.

This page is a (simplified) template Bootstrap 5 Carousel (5 NOT 4 or 3...plenty of these already out there) for users looking at integrating a carousel with multiple elements (cards, images etc).

Bootstrap 5 BY DEFAULT comes with no jquery so this template makes use of pure javascript to make the advance in eiother direction.

The carousel auto starts and has the bare minimum to get it going.

I created this because I could not find one anywhere on the net that could handle multiple elements per slide and advance one element at a time...using only plain javascript...maybe because Bootstrap 5 (without jquery) was quite new at the time I created it.
